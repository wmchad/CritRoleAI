# Jupyter Notebooks

The code here is in Jupyter notebooks for ease of learning, communicating, and
trying things out. It is separated into multiple folders for different explorations:

- [Data Preparation](data_prep): Downloading the data into a format usable for
  ML tasks, as well as exploring and visualizing the data in various ways.
