# CritRoleAI

## Purpose

This repository is intended to be a learning playground to explore different
Machiine Learning/Artificial Intelligence frameworks on data from [Critical
Role](https://critrole.com/).

## Data

We are using [transcript data](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Transcripts)
from the [Critical Role Wiki](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki). This
includes multiple campaigns, arcs, and episodes, as well as mini-campaigns,
one-shots, and special episodes.

The transcripts themselves have speaker and dialogue, and so can potentially be
used for many machine learning tasks:

- Speaker prediction based on the dialogue
- Sentiment analysis
- AI-generated dialogue
